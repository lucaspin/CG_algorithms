# CG Algorithms

This is a wrapper for all the Computer Graphics algorithms of the Computer Graphics class on University of SÃ£o Paulo (UNESP).

The current algorithms present here are:

- DDA algorithm for drawing lines
- Bresenham algorithm for drawing lines and circles
- Scan Line algorithm for filling polygons

## TODO

Implement 2D transformations

- Create the Matrix2d class
- Create a constructor that accepts a vector of values to initialize the Matrix2d
- object values
- Implement functions to get and set the value of a Matrix2d
- Overload the * operator to multiply objects of class Matrix2d
- Create the TransformationMatrix class as a singleton
- Implement function for translation
- Implement function for rotation
- Implement function for scaling
- Implement function for mirroring
