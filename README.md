# CG Algorithms

This is a wrapper for all the Computer Graphics algorithms of the Computer Graphics class on University of SÃ£o Paulo (UNESP).

The current algorithms present here are:

- DDA algorithm for drawing lines
- Bresenham algorithm for drawing lines and circles
- Scan Line algorithm for filling polygons
- Matrix2d class

## TODO

Implement 2D transformations

- [x] Create the Matrix2d class
- [x] Create a constructor that accepts a vector of values to initialize the Matrix2d
- [x] Implement functions to get and set the value of a Matrix2d
- [x] Overload the * operator to multiply objects of class Matrix2d (dot product)
- [ ] Create the TransformationMatrix class as a singleton
- [ ] Implement function for translation
- [ ] Implement function for rotation
- [ ] Implement function for scaling
- [ ] Implement function for mirroring
