# CG Algorithms

This is a wrapper for all the Computer Graphics algorithms of the Computer Graphics class on University of SÃ£o Paulo (UNESP).

The current algorithms present here are:

- DDA algorithm for drawing lines
- Bresenham algorithm for drawing lines and circles
- Scan Line algorithm for filling polygons
- 2D transformations

## TODO

Implement 2D transformations

- [ ] Implement function for mirroring

Clipping 
- [ ] Implement clipLine in ViewportWindows class - Cohen-Sutherland algorithm
- [ ] Implement clipPolygon in ViewportWindows class - Hodgman-Sutherland algorithm
- [ ] review the ViewportWindow class (specially clip method)
