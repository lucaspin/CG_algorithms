# CG Algorithms

This is a wrapper for all the Computer Graphics algorithms of the Computer Graphics class on University of SÃ£o Paulo (UNESP).

The current algorithms present here are:

- DDA algorithm for drawing lines
- Bresenham algorithm for drawing lines and circles
- Scan Line algorithm for filling polygons
- 2D transformations
- 2D Clipping (in ViewportWindows class)
  - clipLine - Cohen-Sutherland algorithm
  - clipPolygon - Hodgman-Sutherland algorithm

## TODO

- [ ] Implement function for mirroring
- [ ] review the ViewportWindow class (specially clip method)
- [ ] review bugs in Bresenham algorithm
- [ ] Implement 3D basic structures
