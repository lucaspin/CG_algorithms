# CG Algorithms

This is a wrapper for all the Computer Graphics algorithms of the Computer Graphics class on University of São Paulo (UNESP).

The current algorithms present here are:

- DDA algorithm for drawing lines
- Bresenham algorithm for drawing lines and circles
- Scan Line algorithm for filling polygons
- 2D transformations
- 2D Clipping (in ViewportWindows class)
  - clipLine - Cohen-Sutherland algorithm
  - clipPolygon - Hodgman-Sutherland algorithm

This is our release version, in order to present to the Professor Denis Salvadeo.
We included some animation to demonstrate this Graphic Engine!
