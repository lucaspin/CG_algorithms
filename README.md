# CG Algorithms

This is a wrapper for all the Computer Graphics algorithms of the Computer Graphics class on University of SÃ£o Paulo (UNESP).

The current algorithms present here are:

- DDA algorithm for drawing lines
- Bresenham algorithm for drawing lines and circles
- Scan Line algorithm for filling polygons
- 2D transformations

## TODO

Implement 2D transformations

- [ ] Implement function for mirroring
- [ ] Create a namespace for all the transformation functions
- [ ] Fix scale transformation issue
